Overview

------------

The function "Denoise_single_image" demonstrates denoising with the external datasets 
introduced in the paper for a single image. To denoise a datasets use "Denoise_Datasets"




Dependency

------------

This code is implemented purely in Matlab2017b. This code depends on the CBM3D for denoising two color channels and block matching from targeted image denoising (TID) by Luo.
