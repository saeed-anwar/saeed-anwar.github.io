I am a Research Scientist at [Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au/), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ([CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/)), Australia in Cyber-Physical Systems, adjunct Lecturer at Australian National University ([ANU](http://https://www.anu.edu.au/)) and visiting fellow at University of Technology Sydney ([UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/)). I completed my PhD at the Computer Vision Research Group (CVRG) at [Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au/) (previously known as NICTA), [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/) and College of Electrical & Computer Science ([CECS](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/)), Australian National University  (ANU) under supervision of [Prof. Fatih Porikli](http://www.porikli.com/) and [Dr. Cong Phuoc Huynh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cong-phuoc-huynh-61891b15). <br><br>

Previously, I completed my MS in Computer Vision and Robotics from [The Heriot-Watt University, University of Girona, and the University of Bourgogne](http://www.vibot.org/) (vibot). I have completed my MS thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammed Dabbah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabbah).

### Full Ph.D. scholarships available
I am looking for Ph.D. students with exceptional English ability, coding ability, and research experience. The candidate must have a high GPA and rich experience in research with publications in top venues. Drop me an email if you are interested.
