I am a Research Scientist at the Computer Vision Research Group (CVRG) at [Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au/), [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/) (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization). I am also an Adjunct Lecturer at [College of Electrical & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/) (CECS), [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) (ANU) and a Research Affiliate with the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision](http://roboticvision.org/) (ACRV).<br><br>

Previosuly, I completed my PhD in Computer Vision from [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/) (UWA), under the supervision of [W/Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun](http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00051632/). My PhD thesis received `[Honorable Mention on the Dean's List](http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/students/funding/prizes/board-of-the-graduate-research-school-deans-list)' award at the UWA. I also completed an internship at [NICTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA) (National ICT Australia) in 2015.
