If you are an excellent student and interested to undertake a research based degree at ANU focussed in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition and/or Image Processing, please drop me an email with your CV and a brief research proposal. We can then discuss potential research projects and scholarships available to you. Below, I summarize the scholarships for which you may be eligible. <br><br>

**Data61 Scholarships**

Data61 (CSIRO) provides generous support to PhD students in the form of full scholarships (same rate as Australian Postgraduate Award) or top-up stipends ($10,000 per annum) for a duation of up to 3.5 years. Each year, these scholarships are normally offered in two rounds (normally around August and March). You will still need to apply at the partner university (ANU) and follow their normal application procedure. 
> Note that the application dates for domestic and international applicants may be different!
