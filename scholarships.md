<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:10px;">Research Fellow</h4>
My group does not have openings for research fellows.

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:10px;">PhD Students</h4>
I am seeking highly motivated PhD students with exceptional English proficiency, strong coding skills, and relevant research experience. A prospective student should have a high GPA and extensive research experience.

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:10px;">Visiting Students</h4>
If you are interested in a visiting scholar position, please be kindly advised that I do not provide funding for it. If you can secure external funding support and if you are highly motivated and experienced in research, please drop me an email.

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:10px;">UWA or ANU Master's Students</h4>
If you are a UWA or ANU master's student seeking individual projects, you should have a research background, a good GPA, and coding skills. You should also have sufficient time for research.

<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-top:10px;">UWA Undergraduate Students</h4>
If you are a UWA undergraduate seeking an Honours project, please note that I typically take on 2-3 Honours students each year and prefer 24-unit projects.
