**Research Fellow** My group does not have openings for research fellows.

**PhD students** I am seeking highly motivated PhD students with exceptional English proficiency, strong coding skills, and relevant research experience. A prospective student should have a high GPA and extensive research experience.

**Visiting students** If you are interested in a visiting scholar position, please be kindly advised that I do not provide funding for it. If you can secure external funding support and if you are highly motivated and experienced in research, please drop me an email.

**UWA or ANU Master's Students** If you are a UWA or ANU master's student seeking individual projects, you should have a research background, a good GPA, and coding skills. You should also have sufficient time for research.

**UWA Undergraduate Students** If you are a UWA undergraduate seeking an Honours project, please note that I typically take on 2-3 Honours students each year and prefer 24-unit projects.
